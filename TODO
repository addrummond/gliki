== Make development easier ==
* Add logging function to control.py
* Allow KID templates to be modified without restarting server.

== Cruicial ==
* "Last seen" field for users so that we can add a message saying that their
  user page has been edited or commented on.
* Tree drawing (bugs in sizing trees, but 90% complete).
* Finish code in gliki.py for handling redirects.
* Fix bad line/column numbers in parser.
* At least do something with parser error messages, and use Javascript to place
  cursor at location of error.
* Preferences page -- either get rid of it or implement email feature.
* Table of contents for articles.
* Allow list of articles, list of categories and page history to be split
  over multiple pages when it gets too big.
* Log IP addresses for edits made from accounts.

== Would be nice ==
* Remove dependence on diff, and do diffs properly (not just line by line).
* Unicode audit (unicode seems to work fine, but only by a UTF-8 miracle)
* Color links to existent/non-existent articles differently.
* Orphaned, abandoned pages, etc.
* Provide a way of uploading images.
* Correct positioning of example numbers.
* Automatically find the dimensions of images + check that the link isn't broken.
* Bibliography features. (Could this ever be worth the trouble?)
* Don't store plaintext passwords?

== Fixing parser error messages ==
Make sure we get good errors for the following specific cases:

    * EOF before closing of ** etc.
    * Mismatched bold/italic/etc. closing. E.g. "**fooo//bar**"
    * Missing == at the end of a section title.
    * Mismatched '<' and '>' in a glossed example.
    * [[ or {{ without closing }} or ]].
    * @@ without closing @@.
    * "[:example]" instead of "[:example:]"
    * Subscript/superscript errors (different opening and closing symbols,
      so perhaps we can do better than for ** etc.)
