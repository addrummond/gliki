== Cruicial ==
* Tree drawing (bugs in sizing trees, but 90% complete).
* Fix bad line/column numbers in parser (this is now 90% done).
* Get cursor placement working in IE and other non-Firefox browsers.
* Use watchlist preference.
* List of a user's contributions.
* Facility for changing password.

== Would be nice ==
* Client-side validation.
* Remove all error messages from gliki.py and shift them to templates.
* Table of contents for articles.
* Do diffs properly (not just line by line).
* Orphaned, abandoned pages, etc.
* Provide a way of uploading images.
* Correct positioning of example numbers.
* Automatically find the dimensions of images + check that the link isn't broken.

== Fixing parser error messages ==
Make sure we get good errors for the following specific cases:

    * EOF before closing of ** etc.
    * Mismatched bold/italic/etc. closing. E.g. "**fooo//bar**"
    * Missing == at the end of a section title.
    * Mismatched '<' and '>' in a glossed example.
    * [[ or {{ without closing }} or ]].
    * @@ without closing @@.
    * "[:example]" instead of "[:example:]"
    * Subscript/superscript errors (different opening and closing symbols,
      so perhaps we can do better than for ** etc.)
